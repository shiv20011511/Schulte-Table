He is passionate about technology and dedicates himself to continuous learning and applying his knowledge to innovative projects. His relentless pursuit of excellence and commitment to honing his skills have earned him the moniker &quot;Hustler.&quot;&#10;&#10;          The Concept:&#10;&#10;       &quot;Hustler's Schulte Table Game&quot; is a testament to Shivkant's dedication and ingenuity.
